# Laravel DC Comics

This is a simple laravel project intended to practice CRUD operations. The "comics" page will display a list of comics. It is possible to click on the "View Details" button to display a page with additional info about the comic. It is also possible to add new comics to the database with a form, which will then redirect to the details page of the newly created comic.

Update:

Added "Edit Comic" form & "Delete" button with confirmation modal.
